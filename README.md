# RSA-encryption
## How to use it ?
You need to create a file called "message.txt" with the text you want to encrypt.
By executing rsa_chiff.c, you will generate a crypted file (called crypted_file.txt) and private_key.txt which contain your private key, hashed.
By executing rsa_dechiff.c, you will decrypt crypted_file.txt. Your initial message should now be in decrypted_file.txt.

## Notes
You have to enter a NUMERICAL password during encryption !
